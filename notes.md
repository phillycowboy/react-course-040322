EVERYTIME YOU CREATE-REACT-APP, DELETE GIT FILE AND PUSH THE SECTION FROM ROOT FOLDER. 

/* Remove Git tracking from an entire folder/directory */
cd projectName // Navigate to the project directory.
rm -rf . git // Remove git tracking.


AND EVERY NEW PROJECT WITHIN THE COURSE MAKE A NEW BRANCH!


npx create-react-app my-app
